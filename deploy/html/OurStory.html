      <div class="herotext">
        <p>After spending the last five years at a little storefront on Conrad Street, founder Peicha Chang and her team moved and rebranded then store Falls Flowers to the Vault + Vine we know today. The new Midvale location has allowed us to expand and offer an immersive retail experience while providing the community with a cafe, gathering place, and small scale event venue.
         </p>

        <p>Our customers are friends and neighbors who, over the years, have become family. Local creators, whose hands are part of every process of making their goods, produce many of the objects we carry. The seasonal flowers we use in our arrangements are grown in and around Philadelphia at small farms, and are harvested and delivered to us by the same farmers who planted the seeds. Any of our products or flowers not locally produced or grown are always sourced responsibly and ethically.

          Our hope is that Vault + Vine becomes for each person who walks through the door what it has become for us: an urban oasis in the East Falls neighborhood of Philadelphia; an atmosphere of abundance and respite; a space for beauty, whimsy, and rejuvenation.

      <h1 class="diff"> Why We're Different</h1>
      <h2 class="diffsub"> We're A B-Corporation</h2>
      <p class="bodytop"> Falls Flowers was the first floral-retail and event design studio to "live” sustainably as one of 1,600+ businesses worldwide that is a certified B-Corp, and Vault + Vine aims to continue that legacy. A B-Corp is a for-profit company certified by the nonprofit B Lab to meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. Our motto is “People using business as a force for good,’ with a focus on a triple bottom line: people, planet, AND profit. We strive to do what a good business should do: support our community, buy and source locally, pay our employees well, and follow high standards of sustainability.

      <h2 class="mission"> Our Mission</h2>
      <p class="missionst">Vault + Vine endeavors to engage our local community in meaningful ways. Through volunteerism, financial support, involvement in community groups, and providing a safe space for all to gather, we aim to provide the best of what the world has to offer to you. We do this by working with our suppliers and vendors to hold ourselves to higher standards. By sourcing hyper-locally whenever possible, we support the people who support us. Our employees are paid a living wage, with opportunities for growth within our company. Our commitment to sustainability transcends the traditional definitions of sustainability, as our B-Corp Certification demonstrates.
